This interactive Power BI report was developed using the Superstore dataset to provide a comprehensive, data-driven view of sales, customer behavior, product performance, and profitability across categories and time. The report is structured into three main pages—Executive Dashboard, Product Details, and Customer Details—and is designed for business users to derive actionable insights using interactive visualizations, filters, and dynamic parameters.

2. AdventureWorks Reports: AdventureWorks represents a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipments and accessories.
